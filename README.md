# Code-Quiz-Project

## Description
For this project i was tasked with creating a javascript code quiz using html, css, and javascript. The purpose of this project was to help better learn javascript and API's. This project was centered around the use of creating java functions and certain API's like local storage and event listeners. I learned a lot of tricks during the creation of this, like how to hide a screen until a button is clicked, and furthered my javascript knowledge greatly.


## Usage
To play my game you start by pressing the start quiz button. You will then be presented with a timer and the first question. Once you press your answer you will be alerted whether it was correct or incorrect. Once you have finished the quiz you will be presented with your score and a place to store you initials and score for a leaderboard.
